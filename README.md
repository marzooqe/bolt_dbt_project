Bolt’s mission is to make cities for people, not cars. To fulfil that mission, we are offering a
number of mobility and other services that reduce the need for private cars: ride hailing,
micromobility, carsharing and delivery. To further support the cause, we have
(hypothetically!) launched another service: Air Boltic.
Air Boltic is a marketplace for sharing aeroplane rides. On one side of the market there are
aeroplane operators, ready to fly from anywhere to anywhere. On the other side of the
market there are individuals and groups who need to get from A to B.
After a few months of operating in Europe, we see that the service is doing great in some
regions, while it hasn’t taken off in others areas. We want to replicate the success in all of
our regions and expand outwards, envisioning to facilitate 20% of all aeroplane rides across
the globe in 2030. To achieve the goal, we need to understand what are the drivers of
growth: the kind of customers we serve well, the kind of use cases we cover (short or long,
from where to where, low cost or premium, small or big planes etc). To make sure the
business fits into our portfolio, we also monitor daily/weekly/monthly active users, revenue
and other metrics that we can compare to our older business lines.
We are providing you with small samples of datasets from our Air Boltic system:
- aeroplane_model.json - a JSON file that holds information about aeroplane models
- Air Boltic data - a Google Sheets file with multiple tabs, representing tables about
trips, orders, aeroplanes, customers and customer groups
The aeroplanes table holds information about individual aircrafts that operate on the
platform, while the aeroplane models file describes the available models on the market. Trips
represent aeroplane rides, while orders represent customers purchasing seats on those
trips. You will quickly figure out the other details from the column names in the tables.
Your task is to design a data model that enables monitoring and self-service analysis
of the Air Boltic service. Keep in mind the scale we plan to achieve. Apply industry best
practices to ensure reliability, scalability, maintainability, high quality and good user
experience for your data users.
